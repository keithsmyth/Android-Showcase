# Android-Showcase
Implementation of an open API to showcase coding practices and architecture

# Goals, notes
- Showcase coding style
- Showcase project architecture, aiming for medium-large size project
- Trying out different methods of rapid application development
- Practicing trunk based development (in a team of one, but you get the idea)
- Initial implementation in Android views, migration to Compose planned
- Building on a low spec laptop, to encourage me to keep the build light
